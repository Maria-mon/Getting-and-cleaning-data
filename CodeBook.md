The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we capturedaxial linear acceleration andaxial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. . The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals  were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap. The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
