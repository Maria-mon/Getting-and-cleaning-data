Getting-and-cleaning-data
THIS REPO WAS CREATED TO FINISH THE ASSIGNMENT OF GETTING AND CLEANING DATA
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

DESCRIPTION: variables X are sensor signal from 30 subjects. Variable Y is the activity type that the subjects are realizing during recording.
the code  combined training data set and test set, then a new generated data set contained the variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation.
the instructions were:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
